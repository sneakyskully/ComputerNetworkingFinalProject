# ComputerNetworkingFinalProject

Project Assignment: Set up a wide area network (WAN) for a mock bank that includes three LANs (one
of which will be partitioned with three VLANs), and configure all network devices
and endpoints to communicate with the entire WAN.

COMPLETED TASKS:
- Devised network topology plan and subnets.
- Built VLANs, trunks, and routing to allow communication across entire network between branches. Arranged switches to implement port security and routers to work with OSPF.
- Configured network devices to prevent unauthorized access by securing privilege mode, encrypting passwords and designing security messaging. Conducted a successful connectivity test, including remote access to network devices.

Utilized Cisco Packet Tracer.
